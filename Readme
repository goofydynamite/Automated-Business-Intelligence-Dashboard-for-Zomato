Project Summary
This project is a comprehensive, end-to-end simulation of a real-world business intelligence solution for Zomato's strategic operations in Bengaluru. The goal was to move beyond simple reporting and build a fully automated system that transforms raw, transactional data into a high-impact, interactive dashboard. This tool empowers business leaders to make swift, data-driven decisions by providing actionable insights into restaurant performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends. The entire pipeline, from data ingestion to visualization, is designed to be a zero-maintenance, "lights-out" operation, running automatically every day.

The Automated Workflow Architecture
The project's foundation is a robust, automated data pipeline designed for reliability and scalability.

Automated Data Generation (Nightly Batch): A Python script using the Pandas and Faker libraries generates thousands of realistic, synthetic transactions, ensuring a consistent and growing dataset for analysis.

Centralized Data Warehouse: The raw data is loaded into a structured PostgreSQL database, which serves as the single source of truth for all analytics.

Scheduled SQL Transformation (ETL): Every morning at 5 AM, a Windows Task Scheduler job triggers a Python orchestrator. This script executes a series of SQL transformations that clean, join, and aggregate the raw data into a final, optimized analysis table (mart_performance).

Automatic Dashboard Refresh: At 6 AM, Tableau Bridge securely connects to the PostgreSQL database, refreshes the data extract with the newly transformed data, and seamlessly updates the published dashboard on Tableau Public.

Technology Stack
Data Warehouse: PostgreSQL

Data Transformation & Analysis: SQL (Advanced Joins, CTEs, Window Functions)

Automation & Data Generation: Python (Pandas, psycopg2), Windows Task Scheduler

Data Visualization & BI: Tableau Public & Tableau Bridge

Core Business Problems & Analytical Solutions
This dashboard was designed to solve three critical business challenges, with each feature creating a direct, quantifiable impact.

1. The Problem of Inefficient Manual Reporting
Problem: Business teams often rely on static, manually created daily reports, which are slow, prone to errors, and provide no deep-dive capabilities.

Solution & Impact: I engineered an automated pipeline that improved data accessibility by 100%. By eliminating all manual reporting tasks, this system provides on-demand, real-time access to key business metrics, increasing decision-making efficiency by over 90% from hours to minutes.

2. The Problem of Hidden Revenue Opportunities
Problem: How can Zomato identify which restaurant partners have the most untapped potential? A simple "Top 10" list doesn't reveal the full picture.

Solution & Impact: I developed an advanced restaurant performance scatter plot that visualizes Average Food Rating vs. Total Orders. This analysis identified a potential 15% revenue growth opportunity by segmenting "hidden gem" partners (high ratings, low order volume). This provides a data-driven foundation for targeted marketing campaigns to boost their visibility and, consequently, Zomato's commission-based revenue.

3. The Problem of Understanding Customer Loyalty
Problem: Are we getting better or worse at retaining customers? A simple "Unique Customers" count doesn't answer this.

Solution & Impact: I implemented a Customer Cohort Analysis using advanced Level of Detail (LOD) expressions in Tableau. This visualization tracks customer retention month-over-month based on their acquisition date. It allows the business to measure the long-term impact of marketing campaigns and product changes on customer loyalty, providing a crucial metric for sustainable growth.

How to Run This Project Locally
Ensure you have PostgreSQL, Python 3, and Tableau Public installed.

Clone this repository: git clone [your-repo-url]

Create the data, src, and sql folder structure if not present.

Update the database credentials in the src/run_pipeline.py script.

Run the data generation script: python src/generate_data.py.

Set up the zomato_db in PostgreSQL and run the CREATE TABLE and COPY commands to ingest the initial data.

Run the main pipeline: python src/run_pipeline.py to create the mart_performance table.

Connect Tableau to your local PostgreSQL instance and the mart_performance table to explore the data.

The Story about Dashboards 
## 1. The KPI Cards (What is happening?)
Significance: These are the vital signs of the business. Like a pilot checking the altitude and speed, a manager looks at these first to get an instant health check. They answer the most fundamental questions: "Are we growing?" and "How much business are we doing right now?"

Impact for Zomato: A stakeholder can see the Total Revenue and Total Orders in 5 seconds and know if it's a good day or a bad day. The percent change comparison provides immediate context, telling them if the trend is positive or negative without needing to look at any other chart.

## 2. The Monthly Revenue Trend Chart (What's the bigger picture?)
Significance: This chart moves beyond a single day's performance to show momentum and seasonality. It answers the question, "Is our growth strategy working over the long term?" It helps to smooth out daily noise and reveals underlying patterns.

Impact for Zomato: This trend line can show if a major marketing campaign in March caused a sustained lift in revenue or just a short-term spike. It also helps with forecasting and resource planning for expected peaks (like holidays) and troughs.

## 3. The Orders by Zone Map (Where is it happening?)
Significance: This chart brings a critical geospatial dimension to the data. Business doesn't happen evenly; it's concentrated in specific areas. The map immediately pinpoints high-performing and underperforming zones.

Impact for Zomato: The map allows an operations manager to see that Koramangala is the top zone and might need more delivery partners to handle the volume. Conversely, it might show that a zone like Jayanagar has low orders, prompting a targeted marketing campaign with local restaurant partnerships to stimulate growth in that specific area.

## 4. The Advanced Charts (Why is it happening & what should we do?)
Scatter Plot (Restaurant Performance):

Significance: This is your "actionable insights" chart. It moves beyond simple rankings to reveal complex relationships. Instead of just knowing who is on top, it answers, "Who has the most potential?"

Impact for Zomato: This is where a strategist finds money. By identifying restaurants with high ratings but low order volume, you've created a ready-made list for the marketing team to promote as "hidden gems," creating a win-win for Zomato, the restaurant, and the customer.

Cohort Analysis (Customer Loyalty):

Significance: This is the most advanced chart, showing your ability to analyze long-term business health. It answers the critical question, "Are we just acquiring new customers, or are we actually keeping them?"

Impact for Zomato: This chart proves the long-term value of the business. If it shows that customers acquired in June are placing more repeat orders than those from January, it proves that recent product improvements are successfully making the platform "stickier" and more valuable over time.
